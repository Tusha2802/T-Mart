        <div style="margin-left: 30px;text-align: left;font-size: 19px;margin-right: 40px;">
            <b>Customer Obsession</b><br>
                <div style="margin-left: 35px;">Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. 
                They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. 
                Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.<br>
                </div>
            <b>Ownership</b>
               <div style="margin-left: 35px;">Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. 
               They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. 
               They never say "that's not my job."<br>
               </div>
            <b>Invent and Simplify</b>
                <div style="margin-left: 35px;">Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify.
                They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not 
                invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
